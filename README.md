# My ERC20 Token 💰

## About
In this project, I create my own ERC-20 token manually as well as using Oppenzeppelin-contract library. 

## Reference
[ERC-20: Token Standard doc](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

## Usage
### OpenZeppelin

[OpenZeppelin Contracts Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)
<br><br>
[OpenZeppelin GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
<br>

### Installing OpenZeppelin Contracts Package

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```


## Quickstart 🚀
```
git clone https://github.com/alfheimrShiven/MyERC20Token.git
cd MyERC20Token
forge build
```

## Testing
`forge test`

or

`forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`

#### Test coverage
`forge coverage`

## Deploy

### Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

### Deploy on local ANVIL chain ⛓️
`make deploy`
### Deploy on Sepolia test net ⛓️
1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```
